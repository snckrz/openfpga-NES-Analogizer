# Pocket openFPGA NES Core with support for Analogizer-FPGA adapter

## Composite Blend

This is my fork of [RndMnkIII's NES Analogizer v1.1.0](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/openfpga-NES-Analogizer/tree/c9bb903cebf4da1d449a16eed42f3a3fdb04f5ce), based on [agg23's NES core](https://github.com/agg23/openFPGA-NES). It adds nine Composite Blend modes to the Pocket and Analogizer RGB video paths.

The filter approximates luma as `Y = (R + 2G + B) / 4`, then derives `Cr = R - Y` and `Cb = B - Y`. It applies selectable horizontal filters to those components, reconstructs RGB, and clips the result to the 8-bit range. PAL modes blend chroma with the previous scanline; luma is not filtered vertically. This is a bandwidth-filtering approximation: it does not encode or decode a composite waveform or model a color subcarrier, so it is not a full NTSC/PAL composite-video simulation.

| Composite Blend | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Off | Unfiltered RGB |
| Kitrinx Style | Simple horizontal RGB averaging, adapted from [Kitrinx's `cofi.sv`](https://github.com/opengateware/openFPGA-Genesis/blob/0032b2c6904131f11496396763a3d8b1a4a19445/src/fpga/core/rtl/cofi.sv) |
| NTSC Light / Medium / Strong | Increasing horizontal luma/chroma filtering |
| PAL Light / Medium / Strong / Strong+ | NTSC-style filtering with previous-line chroma blending |

---
For the PAL/NTSC/Dendy ROM detection the Chip32 loader reads the NES game ROM header previously to load the core to decode the system type, this needs a iNES2.0 ROM header. If the ROM that are you using is of an older header type or not `analogizer.bin` file is detected the core will boot into NTSC mode. 

The Loader uses the regional settings from `analogizer.bin`file to determine the mode the ROM is loaded/NES hardware runs. 
The settings are:
 1) Auto>NTSC:     Try to autodetect the regional setting from the ROM header. If the ROM is `Multi-System` uses the NTSC mode.
 2) Auto>PAL:      Try to autodetect the regional setting from the ROM header. If the ROM is `Multi-System` uses the PAL mode.
 3) Auto>Another:  Try to autodetect the regional setting from the ROM header. If the ROM is `Multi-System` uses the Dendy mode.
 4) Force NTSC:    The ROM uses the NTSC mode. 
 5) Force PAL:     The ROM uses the PAL mode. 
 6) Force Another: The ROM uses the Dendy mode. 

This Analogizer core uses a configuration file to select Analogizer adapter options, not based on the Pocket's menu system. It is necessary to run an external utility [Pupdate >= 4.4.0](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate/releases)  or [AnalogizerConfigurator >= 0.4](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/AnalogizerConfigurator/releases) to generate such a file. Once generated, you must copy the analogizer.bin file to the /Assets/analogizer/common folder on the Pocket SD card. If this folder does not exist, you must create it. Check the refered utility for the relevant options for the Analogizer adapter: SNAC controller, SNAC controller assigments (how to map physical SNAC game controllers to the Pocket openFPGA framework PAD format), Video output and Blank the Pocket Screen (On/Off).

This utility allows you to do a few things beyond the usual SNAC controller type and assignment, or video output type and blank of the Pocket screen.

Tested NES SNAC adapters working with the Zapper lightgun:

The Analogizer interface allow to mix game inputs from compatible SNAC gamepads supported by Analogizer (DB15 Neogeo, NES, SNES, PCEngine, PSX) with Analogue Pocket built-in controls or from Dock USB or wireless supported controllers (Analogue support).

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:

```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
``` 

* **Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.
However, depending on the type of screen you have, passive Y/C adapters could work with different degrees of success.

Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.

Ported from the core originally developed by [Ludvig Strigeus](https://github.com/strigeus/fpganes) and heavily developed by [@sorgelig](https://github.com/sorgelig), [@greyrogue](https://github.com/greyrogue), [@Kitrinx](https://github.com/Kitrinx), [@paulb-nl](https://github.com/paulb-nl), and many more. Core icon by [spiritualized1997](https://github.com/spiritualized1997). Latest upstream available at https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/NES_MiSTer

Please report any issues encountered to this repo. Most likely any problems are a result of my port, not the original core. Issues will be upstreamed as necessary.

## Installation

### Easy mode

I highly recommend the updater tools by [@mattpannella](https://github.com/mattpannella) and [@RetroDriven](https://github.com/RetroDriven). If you're running Windows, use [the RetroDriven GUI](https://github.com/RetroDriven/Pocket_Updater), or if you prefer the CLI, use [the mattpannella tool](https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket_core_autoupdate_net). Either tool installs the published upstream core; the filter in this fork is not included.

### Manual mode

To test this fork, copy the `Assets`, `Cores`, and `Platforms` folders from the matching private test package to the SD root, then copy its four matching bitstreams to `Cores/RndMnkIII.NES_Analogizer`. Back up that core folder first. Preserve your Analogizer configuration and custom palettes. Restore the backup to revert. On macOS, merge folders manually because Finder replaces them.

## Usage

ROMs should be placed in `/Assets/nes/common`

The loader uses iNES 2.0 region metadata and Analogizer regional settings to choose NTSC, PAL, or Dendy behavior. ROMs without an iNES 2.0 header bypass region selection and boot in NTSC mode.

## Features

### Dock Support

Core supports four players/controllers via the Analogue Dock. To enable four player mode, turn on `Use Multitap` setting.

### Mappers

This core has parity with the MiSTer core's mapper support. [See the full breakdown here](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/NES_MiSTer#supported-mappers). Please note that the VRC7 expansion audio chip is not supported in this core (but is in MiSTer) due to space constraints.

### Save States/Sleep + Wake and Saves

Memories save/load and Sleep + Wake work in the tested Pocket setup; mapper-wide compatibility has not been established. Cartridge saves have not been tested with this fork.

### Controller Turbo

By configuring the `Turbo Speed` controller option in `Core Settings`, you can use the `X` and `Y` buttons (by default) as `A`/`B` turbo buttons. The period for each of the settings in NTSC are below (PAL will have different timings):

| Setting | Period |
| ------- | ------ |
| 0       | Off    |
| 1       | 3 Hz   |
| 2       | 5 Hz   |
| 3       | 7.5 Hz |
| 4       | 10 Hz  |
| 5       | 15 Hz  |
| 6       | 30 Hz  |

### Expansion Audio

Expansion audio should be supported for every mapper including VRC7. If you encounter a game that is not playing the expanded audio, please report it.

### Palette Options

The core has 5 palette options built in, changable in `Core Settings/Palette`. The palettes are known as:

* Kitrinx 34 by Kitrinx
* Smooth by FirebrandX (Default)
* Wavebeam by NakedArthur
* Sony CXA by FirebrandX
* PC-10 Better by Kitrinx

You can load external palettes as well. This palette is stored at `Assets/nes/agg23.NES/custom.pal`, and can be selected by the sixth option (`Custom`).

For testing, or to temporarily load a new palette, you can choose the `Load Custom Palette` option (make sure to choose `Core Settings/Palette/Custom`). This palette selection is temporary, and will be reset when quitting and reopening the core.

### Analogizer Options

* `Enable Analogizer`- Enables/Disables the Analogizer adapter globall. When it is disabled, bypass the specific settings for Analogizer, this settings makes the SNAC adapter settings be ignored, using Pocket's default inputs, also forces the video output to be forwarded towards Pocket screen.

### Video Options
There are several options provided for tweaking the displayed video:
* `Video Dejitter` - Intended for use with Analogizer video output with a CRT screen to mimick the real behaviour of the NES. Disable it for use with the Pocket screen, the Dock output or Video Scalers as the OSSC.
* `Hide Overscan` - Hides the top and bottom 8 pixels of the video, which would normally be masked by the CRT. Adjusts the aspect ratio to correspond with this modification. This option does nothing in PAL mode
* `Edge Masking` - Masks the sides of the screen in black, depending on the chosen option. The auto setting automatically masks the left side when certain conditions are met.
* `Square Pixels` - The internal resolution of the NES is a 8:7 pixel aspect ratio (wide pixels), which roughly corresponds to what users would see on 4:3 display aspect ratio CRTs. Some games are designed to be displayed at 8:7 PAR (the core's default), and others at 1:1 PAR (square pixels). The `Square Pixels` option is provided to switch to a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio.
* `Extra Sprites` - Allows an extra 8 sprites to be displayed per line (up to 16 from the original 8). Will decrease flickering in some games

### Lightguns

Core supports virtual lightguns by enabling the `Use Zapper > Emulated Zapper (Stick)` setting. The crosshair can be controlled with the D-Pad or left joystick, using the A button to fire. D-Pad aim sensitivity can be adjusted with the "D-Pad Aim Speed" setting. In addition, the Analogizer core version supports directly connecting the Zapper gun using a SNAC NES adapter  by enabling the `Use Zapper > SNAC Zapper` setting

**NOTE:** Joystick support for aiming only appears to work when a controller is paired over Bluetooth and not connected to the Analogue Dock directly by USB.
